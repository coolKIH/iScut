# iScut Student Management System
This was my Database course project, a simple student information management system.

##  Features

- Written in PHP and HTML, 
- with a little javascript and jQuery, and
- offers a simple interface. 

##Note
Before you run the website on your computer, import tables and data from the "iscut-db.sql" - with the use of command line mysql or phpmyadmin.
This project is originally served by apache server accompanied with PHP.
