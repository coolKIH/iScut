##This was my Database course project, a simple student information management system. Written in PHP and HTML, with a little javascript and jQuery, it turns out to display a simple and u><y interface. I might want to make it look better later.

Please before you run the website on your computer, import tables and data from the "iscut-db.sql" - with the use of command line mysql or phpmyadmin.
This project is originally served by apache server accompanied with PHP.
